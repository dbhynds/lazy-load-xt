Lazy Load images, videos, iframes and more using Lazy Load XT.

== Description ==

Lazy load images, YouTube and Vimeo videos, and iframes using [Lazy Load XT](https://github.com/ressio/lazy-load-xt).

Lazy Load XT is the fastest, lightest, fully customizable lazy load plugin in the WordPress Plugin Directory.

This plugin works by loading the Lazy Load XT script and replacing the `src` attributes with `data-src` when the content of a post or page is loaded on the front end of a WordPress site.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

or

1. Download and unzip Lazy Load XT.
1. Upload the `lazy-load-xt` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't my images lazy loading? =

Lazy Load XT filters images added to the page using `the_content`, `post_thumbnail_html`, `widget_text` and `get_avatar`. If your images are added using another function (`wp_get_attachment_image` for example), Lazy Load XT does not filter them. However, as of v0.4, you can filter the HTML yourself by passing it to `get_lazyloadxt_html`.

For example, if a theme has:
`echo wp_get_attachment_image($id);`
Changing it to the following would lazy load the image:
`echo get_lazyloadxt_html( wp_get_attachment_image($id) );`
